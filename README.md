# JustJava

This application was developed using the Android Studios application. The purpose of this app is to create and
submit an order for coffee via email. This was developed during Innovation Project ISP1 and was completed in Innovation
Project ISP Final.

During my time in the online course I learned a multitude of concepts I wasnt sure I was going to understand. 
The only bit of knowledge that I was familiar with was Java and even that was little. Through the time I picked
up many skills and techniques. I learned how XML and Java communicate with each other to be able to create applications with
great UI. The biggest take away for me was when they started to delve into Object-Oriented programming. It's where
all the things I was beginnning to learn started coming together. I learned how you can create styles and themes for the
cosmetics portion of the application as well as going over things such as how inheritance comes into play with creating Applications
for Android. The biggest take away for me was how I learned about intent. Ive always wanted to know how apps communicate with
other apps so this was important for me. The experience I've gain from this project along with the integration project are
lessons I know I will use throughout my career confidently.
